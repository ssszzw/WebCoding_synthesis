Prompt:
“Create an aerial view of Central Park showing seasonal transformation.

Output a single HTML file that runs in a blank Chrome tab with no bundler. If you use Three.js, add an import map (before the module script) mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Never reuse identifiers in the same scope — use descriptive variable names.

VIEW
Looking down at the iconic rectangle of Central Park surrounded by Manhattan's grid. The contrast of nature vs. concrete.

GROUND AND TERRAIN
The park must have visible ground/terrain - grass, paths, the reservoir water. Surrounding streets and buildings form the frame.

SEASONAL STATES (smooth transition via slider)
- Spring: Cherry blossoms (pink clusters), fresh light green, flowers
- Summer: Deep green canopy, full dense trees, active fountains
- Autumn: Orange/red/gold foliage, peak color, some leaves falling
- Winter: Bare grey branches, snow covering paths and grass, frozen reservoir

Transition should be smooth - colors morphing, leaves appearing/disappearing gradually as slider moves.

KEY LANDMARKS
- The Reservoir (oval water body, reflects sky)
- Bethesda Fountain area
- The Mall (tree-lined path)
- Bow Bridge

Surrounding buildings should have more visible lit windows in winter.

CONTROLS
- Season slider (smooth interpolation between all four)
- Time of day
- Zoom to landmark preset buttons
- Free orbit camera

TECHNICAL
- Use InstancedMesh for trees
- Target ≥55 FPS”
