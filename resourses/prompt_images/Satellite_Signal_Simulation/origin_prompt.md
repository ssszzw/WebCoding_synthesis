Create an interactive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript simulation of a satellite system that transmits signals to ground receivers. The simulation should show a satellite orbiting the Earth and periodically sending signals that are received by multiple ground stations. Include realistic factors such as signal delay based on distance, occasional signal loss due to obstructions or interference, and visualization of the signal path as lines or waves. The satellites’ position should be updated using simplified orbital mechanics, and the ground receivers should display received signal strength and timestamps.
